One of the key insights of the CLT is that, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normally distributed as the sample size increases. This is true for a wide range of population distributions, including those that are not normally distributed.\n",

    "In practice, as long as certain conditions of random sampling, independence, and an adequately large sample size are met, the CLT allows us to make approximations using the normal distribution even for populations that do not have a normal distribution. This is why the CLT is such a powerful tool in statistics because it allows us to perform inferential statistics and hypothesis testing in a wide variety of real-world scenarios, even when we don’t know the exact shape of the population distribution."
